# Tic Tac Toe using Minimax Algorithm

Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O.
This is an implementation of Minimax Algorithm for the Tic Tac Toe game.

## Minimax

The minimax algorithm is used in Artificial Intelligence to determine an optimal move for a player in a two-player game. It assumes that the other player is playing optimally.
